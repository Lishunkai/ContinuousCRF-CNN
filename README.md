# Multi-Scale Continuous CRFs as Sequential Deep Networks for Monocular Depth Estimation
By Dan Xu, Elisa Ricci, Wanli Ouyang, Xiaogang Wang and Nicu Sebe
## Introduction
CRF-CNN is a monocular depth estimation approach asscoiated to an arxiv submission https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.02157.pdf which is accepted at CVPR 2017. </br>
The currently published version implements a multi-scale cascade continuous CRF model. The model is implemented as a CNN layer and can be also applicable to other continuous regression problems. </br>
The code is implemented under Caffe and has been tested under the configurations of Ubuntu 14.04, MATLAB 2015b and CUDA 7.0.
